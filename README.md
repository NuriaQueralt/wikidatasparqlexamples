# Query wikidata with SPARQL #

Wikidata has its own SPARQL endpoint. SPARQL queries can be submitted from any at http://wdqs-beta.wmflabs.org/, or its direct url (http://wdqs-beta.wmflabs.org/bigdata/namespace/wdq/sparql). The latter URL allows integrating Wikidata items with external SPARQL endpoints through [federated queries](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/) or to integrate in data analysis packages such as [R](http://www.r-bloggers.com/sparql-with-r-in-less-than-5-minutes/) or any other platform with a SPARQL plugin such as frameworks such as from a external federated query of a framework which includes a SPARQL plugin such as [Text mate with its turtle bundle](https://github.com/peta/turtle.tmbundle).
